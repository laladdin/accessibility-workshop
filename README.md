# accessibility-exercises

Welcome to the introduction page of accessibility exercises for coders! The purpose of this project is to offer a platfor to reherse making accessibility improving changes to a web page. So the sad side of the story is that a large part of people would not be able to use this website, because accessibility has not been taken into account in its development. Do you know what should be done to improve accessibility of this page?

This project has been made with Vue 3 and TypeScript with script setup. You can download the project to your own computer and run it locally. Introductions how to get started are placed in the next chapter.

## Get started

### Prerequisites

Before you can run this project, you need to have the following tools installed on your computer:

-   **Node.js and npm:** Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that is required for running a Vue.js project. npm (Node Package Manager) is included with Node.js and is used for managing and installing project dependencies. You can download Node.js and npm from [here](https://nodejs.org).

-   **A Code Editor:** For writing code, you'll need a code editor. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a great choice for JavaScript and Vue.js development.

    -   **Quality of life extensions:** <b style="color:red">Volar</b> is the recommended extension for vue3 + typescript projects and will save you from some grey hairs (Vetur doesn't work well with vue3).
        <b style="color:red">Prettier, ESLint</b> or some similar extensions that can be set to format code on save.

-   **Git:** Git is a version control system that allows you to track your code changes and work collaboratively with other developers. Download it from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

### Cloning and Running the Project

1. **Clone the project**: Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the project in your terminal/command prompt. Run the following command to clone the project from GitHub:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/laladdin/accessibility-workshop.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**: Use the command `cd accessibility-exercises`.

3. **Install the project dependencies**: In the project directory, run the command `npm install` to install all necessary dependencies.

4. **Start the development server**: Run the command `npm run dev` to start a local development server. Once the server is running, you'll be able to open your project in a web browser.

### Viewing the Project

Open a web browser and navigate to localhost:8080 (or the address specified in your terminal/command prompt after running npm run dev). You should now see your Vue.js project running.
